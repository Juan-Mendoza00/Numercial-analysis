# Numerical Analysis with Python

### Mathematics for Statisticians - Universidad del Valle

This is a project for a college course of Math. The course of 'Mathematics for Statisticians' is part of the **Statistics Program** at La universidad del Valle, Cali-Colombia. The main purpose of this course is to cover different methods of Numerical Analysis by exploring the theory behind as well as their common practial use cases. 

This project aims to build a system that applies **the Newton-Raphson method** to find the root(s) of real-valued functions.
